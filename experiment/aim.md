### Aim 
To design a safe and stable reinforced concrete (RC) isolated footing that can adequately support the axial load from a column in a structure.

### Objective
- Determine the required size and depth of the footing based on the applied axial load and allowable soil bearing capacity
- Design the reinforcement for the footing slab to resist bending moments and shear forces induced by the load
- Ensure the footing meets all relevant code requirements for strength, serviceability, and durability
